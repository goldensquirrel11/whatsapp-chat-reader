           <h3>BY SAYID & YEN HONG</h3>
           <p>The inspiration to make this project came when Sayid was attempting to move from an iphone to an android phone.He realised that whatsApp didn't fully support moving chats between IOS and Android, but he still wanted to be able to view my whatsapp chats from his iphone so he'd just decided to create an app with Yen Hong that is able to parse the chat exported from whatsapp.</p>
